# Memberstack Jekyll

A Jekyll and Bootstrap starter theme for MemberStack featuring a Home page, Login page and a user Dashboard area.

After a few experiments with different SSGs I found that Jekyll is a great fit for Memberstack due to its flexibility.

This is currently alpha as I want to make a nice Homepage and probably a few tweaks to the code to clean it up. But it can be used right now and is working nicely.

Enjoy ðŸ™‚
